        ""art"" for you guys, so if anything, it's because I'm working hard behind
        the scenes. So tell me what a good girl I am!!<br /><br />
        no but seriously i'm sorry for not updating the writing tab it's mostly because
        i think my academic writing is really lackluster as of recent and honestly
        i just need time plus i need to get over the embarrassment that comes to
        me whenever i attempt creative writing like once two years or so back i tried
        writing a fanfic on commission and i cringed at myself every fucking time
        i wrote a line and it just killed my motivation to work so i did nothing
        and left the whole project unfinished it was great lol

            i'd dedicate this space to something really personal to me, like
            some random rant written in "good" prose about what plagues me, but
            honestly, i'd rather save that for the future so i can catch you,
            the imaginary reader, by just randomly inserting that into my later
            work or something. that'd be funny. but for now, i'm gonna put a
            message for ethan here: ethan, you fuck, why haven't you started
            learning japanese yet?? remember that you need to start freeing time
            up in your schedule so you can learn. language learning is not a
            sprint, it's a marathon. you are not going to become fluent over the
            course of, say, one summer. you should be dedicating at least a bit
            of time daily if you're gonna get anywhere. i believe in you, ethan.
            you can do this. come on. don't you want to understand JPT? i know
            you do. go on and do it.

            I would have been as great as George Eliot<br />
            But for an untoward fate.<br />
            For look at the photograph of me made by Peniwit,<br />
            Chin resting on hand, and deep-set eyes--<br />
            Gray, too, and far-searching.<br />
            But there was the old, old problem:<br />
            Should it be celibacy, matrimony or unchastity?<br />
            Then John Slack, the rich druggist, wooed me,<br />
            Luring me with the promise of leisure for my novel,<br />
            And I married him, giving birth to eight children,<br />
            And had no time to write.<br />
            It was all over with me, anyway,<br />
            When I ran the needle in my hand<br />
            While washing the baby's things,<br />
            And died from lock-jaw, an ironical death.<br />
            Hear me, ambitious souls,<br />

            honestly, this didn't come out looking as nice as i originally
            expected. you know that feeeling where you know you've fucked up,
            but you've got to keep going, since you have literally no other
            option, and it's far too late to go back now? that's about how i
            feel at this point. i don't really have anything else i could have
            possibly done before my birthday, and i feel like this is special
            enough to just be deployed. i'm also writing this while i'm too
            tired to properly rant, so this is mostly just filler, i guess. i
            don't know. but yeah, sorry that i couldn't make a better website
            for my special day. i just couldn't really think of anything better
            and i procrastinated too much on it. that's about all there is to
            it, really.

                i wrote this for my common app essay and the funny part is i
                disagree with all of it now
            </p>
            <p>
                I was never exactly the best at the arts. Music never fully made
                sense to me, drawing was a bit out of my reach, and I could
                never truly channel my creativity through writing. I didn't find
                my calling until 8th grade, when I took an introductory CS
                course. I hadn't really done a deep dive into programming
                before, but CS Fundamentals made it all come together. After a
                short amount of time, C turned into a second language for me,
                programming assignments became a breeze, and what I wanted to do
                became clear to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each art has its own vehicle. The musician's songs are performed
                with their own voice or an instrument, the painter's paintings
                are put onto the canvas, and the writer transfers their work
                onto the page. I believe computers are a vehicle for their own
                art—code. Good art is an expression of human creativity, and
                programming is no exception. Programmers write their code not
                for profit, but rather to express themselves; a good program is
                one that simply and creatively achieves the desired result. The
                elegance, creativity, and utter artfulness of a well-written
                snippet of code will shine through the screen, much like
                creativity oozes out of a good piece of writing. A programmer
                can appreciate a good piece of code like a musician can
                appreciate an effectively composed piece of music.
            </p>
            <p>
                I found the art of programming later than a lot of artists find
                their art; my more artistic friends discovered their passions at
                a relatively young age compared to me. However, I took to it
                quickly: by the start of the second semester, I was already
                writing my own personal projects, making contributions to my
                friends' software, and learning an entirely new programming
                language, discovering concepts on my own by doing. Programming
                sort of took over my life as I worked on my passion projects. In
                9th grade, that meant writing plenty of cryptographic software,
                creating my own algorithms, and diving into a bit of electronic
                engineering (which still involves a decent amount of
                programming, and is beautiful in its own way). In 10th grade it
                meant writing more cryptographic apps, planning a new store for
                gaming, implementing cryptographic algorithms, and creating a
                peer-to-peer file-sharing network. This year, I plan on
                expressing myself through larger-scale projects, creating things
                that are meaningful to me in my own way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike most pieces of art, the majority of programs can't be
                divorced from their impact. Programs aren't just pieces of
                creative expression: they can be tools of empowerment. The work
                of programmers can create real-world human impact. For example,
                those working on private messaging apps and proxies allow
                everyone, especially those under authoritarian regimes, to
                express themselves without fear, regain freedom of information,
                and secure their privacy. Of course, there's always a flip side,
                where programs are used for questionable causes—to encroach on
                the right to privacy, to suppress free expression, to censor,
                and to discriminate. However, being a good programmer is not
                just a matter of writing elegantly; it's also a matter of
                positively affecting society. For every programmer there is
                enabling oppression, there are multiple ensuring that essential
                freedoms stay intact, providing newfound resources to others, or
                actively attempting to change the world for the better. I hope
                to be part of the latter camp, improving the world through
                programming and applied cryptography work, refining my art along
                the way.
