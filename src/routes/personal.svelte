            so... a little about me, i suppose? i was born in dallas, tx in
            october 2006; i've lived in the dfw metroplex for my whole life. i'm
            currently 16. i'm a certified homosexual. i've also got a few
            hobbies; i'm a licensed amateur radio operator (general class), a
            furry, and a hobbyist programmer from time to time. plus, i enjoy
            reading and writing about the law. i'm a literature major for a few
            reasons, one of them being that i want to produce art before i head
            off to law school. literature allows me to do that; i might end up
            pursuing a creative writing concentration. i'll put some of my
            selected writings in the writing app from time to time, so check
            back here often.
